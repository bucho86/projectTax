<!-- // You're a JS developer, and you've been asked to build a a tax calculation engine
// - if income greater than 200$, ask them to show proof (ask more questions )
// and show the proof in addition to their net income display
// - for everybody else, show just the net income
// - when the income is greater than $200, do the tax calculation but add a $20 deduction from the gross.
// Algorithms: steps to solve this prob 👆🏾
    // 1. get the gross income
// const grossIncome = prompt("What's you gross income?"); -->
<!-- 5% for income up to $50,000
    5.5% for income between $50,001 and $100,000
    6% for income above $100,000 -->
<!-- // 2. check if the income is greater than $200, if yes, ask for proof
    // 3. calculate the tax based on the income bracket
    // 4. display the net income and the proof if income is greater than $200
    // 5. add a $20 deduction from the gross income if income is greater than $200
    // 6. return the net income
    // 7. use a switch statement to determine the tax rate based on the income bracket
    // 8. use a conditional statement to check if the income is greater than $200
    // 9. use a prompt to ask for the proof if the income is greater than $200
    // 10. use a console.log to display the net income and the proof if the income is
    // greater than $200
    // 11. use a console.log to display the net income if the income is less than or
    // equal to $200
    // 12. use a console.log to display the net income with the $20 deduction if the
    // income is greater than $200
    // 13. use a console.log to display the tax rate based on the income bracket
    // 14. use a console.log to display the tax amount based on the income bracket -->    
    // 2b. get the base tax rate (ma: 4.23% or 0.04)
